# FEM_Simulation_Solid_Mechanics
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) project for solid mechanics and linear elasticity, implemented as part of the Foundations of Materials Simulation course. The project involves solving elasticity problems using the finite element method (FEM), implementing shape functions, and performing numerical integration and matrix assembly.

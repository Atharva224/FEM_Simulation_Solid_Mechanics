# üß± Finite Element Method (FEM) ‚Äì Solid Mechanics Project (MATLAB)

This repository contains a complete 1D finite element simulation and theoretical derivation for linear solid mechanics problems. Developed as part of the *Foundations of Materials Simulation* course at FAU, this project implements the weak form of the governing equations, shape function-based element formulation, numerical quadrature, and stress-displacement analysis using MATLAB.

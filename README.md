# Finite Element Analysis of Solid Mechanics

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** for solving linear elasticity problems in solid mechanics. It involves deriving governing differential equations, implementing shape functions, numerical integration, assembling stiffness matrices, and solving FEM problems. The project was developed as part of the **Foundations of Materials Simulation** course.

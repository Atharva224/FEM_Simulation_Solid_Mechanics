# FEM_Simulation_Solid_Mechanics
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) project for solid mechanics and linear elasticity, implemented as part of the Foundations of Materials Simulation course. The project involves solving elasticity problems using the finite element method (FEM), implementing shape functions, and performing numerical integration and matrix assembly.



# FEM Simulation for Solid Mechanics

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for solving solid mechanics problems, focusing on linear elasticity. The project follows a structured approach, including:
- Derivation of governing differential equations.
- Weak formulation and discretization using shape functions.
- Numerical integration and stiffness matrix assembly.
- Implementation of FEM in Python/MATLAB.
- Solution verification with analytical and MATLAB solutions.

This repository contains both the project code and the final report detailing the methodology and results.
